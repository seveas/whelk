Pretending python is a shell
============================

We all like python for scripting, because it's so much more powerful than a
shell. But sometimes we really need to call a shell command because it's so
much easier than writing yet another library in python or adding a dependency::

  from whelk import shell
  shell.zgrep("-r", "downloads", "/var/log/httpd")
  # Here goes code to process the log

You can even pipe commands together::

  from whelk import pipe
  pipe(pipe.getent("group") | pipe.grep(":1...:"))

Much more usage info can be found at http://seveas.github.io/whelk/

Installing
----------

Installing the latest released version is as simple as::

  pip install whelk

If you want to tinker with the source, you can install the latest source from
github::

  git clone https://github.com/seveas/whelk.git

And finally, Ubuntu users can install whelk from my ppa::

  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:dennis/python
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python-whelk python3-whelk
